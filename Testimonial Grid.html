                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects.

                    Javascript with the React framework library. 
                    I also learned a CSS framework library  Tailwind CSS. Currently if it was not for the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every Penny worth.

It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
